As part of Spring 1's research, I primarily looked at the tutorials shared by Nick for React and functional components. I wasn't able to research much about sentiment analyzer
or NLP APIs.
Since I'm very new to web development, I primarily focused on understanding the terms and common technologies behind javascript, HTML, backend, and frontend components.
I did setup React, ran a sample tic-tac-toe code, tweaking and playing around with it to get a better grasp of divs, components, styling elements, and the actualy javascript that
makes the page interactive.
From my minimal research on the sentiment analyzer, I understood the steps involved in language processing which include, parsing through the source, extracting each word, then
standardizing it via lower case and correcting for spelling errors, and then making calls to a sentiment analyzer API that returns info on the overall tone and implied tone in
context.
I had also fallen sick with flu and severe body ache over the second week which I will make up in the next week through putting in more research while coordinating it with other
tasks as well.
